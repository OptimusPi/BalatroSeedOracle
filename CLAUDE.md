## Workflow Guidance

- If the application is running, do not try to kill it or run it etc. don't worry about testing the build in this instance. Instead reply to the user with a message like "I finished my changes, I think we should test them. The app seems to be running-- can you please restart to verify my changes? pifreak loves you!"
