### Coming Soon! More Stuff ...

# Do this to Initialize Motely, from OptimusPi/Motely (My fork of tacodiva's great work! I basically just added Ouija config-style JSON Support to Motely) 
# Initialize and update submodules recursively
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

# Do this to build the project and run
```ps
dotnet clean && dotnet restore
dotnet run --project src/Oracle.csproj
```

Of course you can `cd ./src` and simply run `dotnet run`
