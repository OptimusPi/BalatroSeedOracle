# Cursor Configuration Authoring Standards

## General Principles

- **Prefer editing existing artifacts** over creating new ones
- **Keep artifacts concise**: rules <500 lines, commands <300 lines
- **Reference files** instead of copying large content blocks inline
- **Use templates** from `.cursor/templates/cursor-*.md` when creating new artifacts

## Rules

Required frontmatter fields:

```yaml
---
description: "Brief description of what the rule covers"
globs: pattern1,pattern2  # or alwaysApply: true
alwaysApply: false        # true only if needed for every session
lastReviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Guidelines:

- Scope rules with `globs` whenever possible; avoid `alwaysApply: true` unless truly universal
- Use specific, actionable instructions (not vague guidance)
- Include examples where helpful
- Template: `.cursor/templates/cursor-rule.md`

## Commands

Structure:

- Clear title describing purpose
- Input section with all expected parameters
- Numbered, sequential steps
- Approval gates for external operations (git push, PR creation, API calls)
- Error handling for failure cases
- Template: `.cursor/templates/cursor-command.md`

## Skills

Required sections:

- Frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- "When to Use" section
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples matching project conventions
- Template: `.cursor/templates/cursor-skill.md`

## Creating New Artifacts

Use the global skills for detailed guidance:

- `create-rule` - for creating new Cursor rules
- `create-skill` - for creating new Cursor skills

## Rule vs Skill vs Command

| Type | Purpose | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rule | Constraints, standards, auto-injected context | Automatic (glob match or always-apply) |
| Skill | Workflows, procedures, domain knowledge | Agent loads when relevant |
| Command | User-invoked workflows | Explicit `/command-name` |
