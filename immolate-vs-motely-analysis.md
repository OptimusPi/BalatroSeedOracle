## 🟢 **EXCELLENT DECISIONS**
Motely improvements over Immolate:

1. **Type Safety**: Uses enums instead of magic strings ✅
2. **Compile-Time Constants**: All keys are `const string` ✅  
3. **Intellisense Support**: Easy to discover available keys ✅
4. **Namespace Organization**: Clean separation of concerns ✅
5. **Performance**: No runtime string lookups ✅

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES**

### 1. **Incomplete Game Implementation**
Motely is missing **~25 major game mechanics** that Immolate supports:
- **Special Jokers**: Wraith, Riff-Raff, Cartomancer, 8-Ball, Gros Michel, Cavendish, Misprint, Erratic
- **Tarot Effects**: Emperor, High Priestess, Judgement, Wheel of Fortune  
- **Spectral Effects**: Superposition, Seance, Sixth Sense
- **Tag Mechanics**: Vagabond, Top-up, Rare Tag, Uncommon Tag, Voucher Tag, Orbital Tag
- **Seal Effects**: Blue Seal, Purple Seal
- **Advanced Features**: Lucky Cards, Sigils, Ouija Board, Boss Blinds

### 2. **Search Accuracy Risk**
Missing mechanics means Motely might:
- Generate **wrong seeds** for complex filters
- **Miss valid seeds** that rely on missing mechanics  
- Produce **different results** than Immolate for identical searches

### 3. **Performance vs Completeness Trade-off**
- Motely prioritized **SIMD performance** over **feature completeness**
- Immolate is **feature-complete** but single-threaded
- This creates a **fundamental gap** in game coverage

## 🤔 **QUESTIONS FOR INVESTIGATION**

1. **Why were these mechanics excluded?** 
   - Performance reasons?
   - Implementation complexity? 
   - Incomplete reverse-engineering?

2. **Are users aware of the limitations?**  
   - Does documentation mention missing features?
   - Are there warnings about incomplete coverage?

3. **Can the missing mechanics be added incrementally?**
   - What's the effort to implement each missing source?
   - Which ones are highest priority for users?

4. **Do the alias discrepancies matter?**
   - Are `"cel1"` vs `"pl1"` actually different?
   - Could this cause subtle bugs?

## 📊 **COMPLETENESS SCORE**
**Motely Coverage: ~75%** of Immolate's functionality
- ✅ **Core mechanics**: Shop, Packs, Basic Jokers, Basic RNG
- ❌ **Advanced mechanics**: Special Jokers, Complex Tarots/Spectrals, Tags, Seals
- ❌ **Edge cases**: Lucky Cards, Boss Blinds, Advanced Interactions

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Document the gaps** - Users should know what's missing
2. **Prioritize missing mechanics** - Add most-requested features first  
3. **Maintain compatibility** - Don't break existing working features
4. **Consider hybrid approach** - Fallback to Immolate for missing mechanics
5. **Add validation** - Warn users when searches require missing features

---

## **TL;DR: Motely is blazingly fast but missing ~25% of Balatro's game mechanics compared to Immolate. Core searches work great, but complex filters involving special jokers, advanced tarots, tags, and seals will give wrong results.** 🎯
