# Search Modal Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented full Motely search integration with console output capture, DuckDB storage, and results display in the BalatroSeedOracle application.

## Changes Made

### 1. SearchModal.axaml
- Added a 4th tab "Results" to the tab navigation
- Created a Results panel with:
  - DataGrid for displaying search results (Seed, Score, Timestamp, Details, Copy action)
  - Results summary text showing total count
  - Export to CSV button
- Updated grid column definitions to accommodate 4 tabs
- Maintained Balatro-themed styling throughout

### 2. SearchModal.axaml.cs
- Added Results tab controls and panel references
- Updated `OnTabClick` to handle Results tab navigation
- Connected DataGrid to `_searchResults` ObservableCollection
- Implemented `OnExportResultsClick` for CSV export functionality
- Enhanced `OnResultFound` to:
  - Update results summary count
  - Enable Results tab when results are found
  - Enable export button
- Modified `LoadFilterAsync` to initialize SearchHistoryService with filter name
- Updated `OnCookClick` to automatically load selected filter if needed

### 3. MotelySearchService.cs
- Already had full Motely integration implemented
- Properly executes searches using the Motely engine
- Captures results via MotelyResultCapture service
- Sends console output via events

### 4. MotelyResultCapture.cs
- Monitors Motely's results queue in real-time
- Automatically saves results to DuckDB via SearchHistoryService
- Raises events for UI updates

### 5. SearchHistoryService.cs
- Creates filter-specific DuckDB databases
- Stores search metadata and results
- Provides `AddSearchResultAsync` method for result persistence

## Features Implemented

### Console Output Capture ✅
- Real-time search progress displayed in console tab
- Shows seeds searched, results found, and search speed
- Timestamped messages for clarity

### DuckDB Storage ✅
- Each filter gets its own `.ouija.duckdb` file
- Results stored with seed, score, timestamp, and score breakdown
- Persistent storage for future reference

### Results Display ✅
- Sortable DataGrid with all result details
- Copy button for each seed
- Export to CSV functionality
- Results count summary

### Search Execution ✅
- Integrated with existing filter system
- Uses selected deck/stake settings
- Respects thread count, batch size, and min score settings
- Start/stop functionality with proper cleanup

## Usage Flow
1. User selects or imports a filter in the Filter tab
2. User configures search settings in the Settings tab
3. User clicks "Let Jimbo COOK!" in the Search tab
4. Console shows real-time progress
5. Results appear in the Results tab as they're found
6. User can copy seeds or export all results to CSV

## Build Status
✅ Build succeeded - All code changes are properly integrated and compile without errors.

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for testing in a Windows environment where the Avalonia UI can properly run.
