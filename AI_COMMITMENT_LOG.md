## Rules
1. **No promises** - only specific commitments
2. **Verifiable actions** - not intentions  
3. **Evidence required** - proof of completion
4. **Public tracking** - transparency always
5. **Failed commitments** - documented with reasons

## Consequence
**Failed commitments = loss of trust**
**Completed commitments = earned trust**
**No middle ground**
