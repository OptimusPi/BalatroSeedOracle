# TreeDataGrid Alternative to DataGrid Guide

## Problem with AvaloniaUI DataGrid

You mentioned having issues with AvaloniaUI's DataGrid in the past, which is a common experience. The current DataGrid in Avalonia:

- Is derived from the Silverlight version (less powerful, more bugs)
- Not fully MVVM-friendly (columns often need code-behind setup)
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Limited customization options

## TreeDataGrid Solution

Avalonia developed TreeDataGrid as a better alternative:

### Benefits:
- **Better Performance**: More performant than DataGrid, especially with large datasets
- **AOT Friendly**: Works with Ahead-of-Time compilation
- **Customizable**: Highly customizable to fit your needs
- **MVVM Support**: Better separation of concerns (though still requires some setup)

### Installation:

1. Add NuGet package to your project:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Avalonia.Controls.TreeDataGrid" Version="11.3.4" />
```

2. Add theme to App.axaml:
```xml
<StyleInclude Source="avares://Avalonia.Controls.TreeDataGrid/Themes/Fluent.axaml"/>
```

## Implementation for Your Results Window

### Option 1: Replace DataGrid with TreeDataGrid

You can replace the existing DataGrid in `DataGridResultsWindow.axaml` with:

```xml
<TreeDataGrid Name="ResultsTreeGrid"
              Source="{Binding ResultsSource}"
              CanUserReorderColumns="True"
              CanUserResizeColumns="True"
              CanUserSortColumns="True"
              SelectionMode="Multiple"/>
```

### Option 2: Alternative Results Window

I've created an example implementation in `/src/Examples/TreeDataGridResultsExample.axaml` that shows:

- How to set up TreeDataGrid with MVVM
- Dynamic column creation based on filter configuration
- Performance-optimized data loading
- Better selection and sorting capabilities

### Key Implementation Details:

1. **FlatTreeDataGridSource**: Use this for tabular (non-hierarchical) data
2. **Dynamic Columns**: Create columns programmatically based on your filter configuration
3. **Observable Collections**: Use ObservableCollection for automatic UI updates
4. **Performance**: TreeDataGrid handles large datasets much better than DataGrid

## Migration Steps

If you want to migrate your existing DataGridResultsWindow to use TreeDataGrid:

1. Install the TreeDataGrid package
2. Add the theme to App.axaml
3. Create a ViewModel with FlatTreeDataGridSource
4. Replace the DataGrid XAML with TreeDataGrid
5. Update the code-behind to work with the new data source

## Alternative: Third-Party Solutions

If TreeDataGrid doesn't meet your needs, consider:

- **Syncfusion DataGrid**: Commercial but very MVVM-friendly and feature-rich
- **DevExpress**: Another commercial option with excellent grid controls
- **Custom Implementation**: Create a simple table using ItemsControl + Grid for basic scenarios

## Current Status Fix

I've already fixed the immediate issue you mentioned:

âœ… **SQL Error Text Selection**: Changed `TextBlock` to `SelectableTextBlock` in both status bars so you can now select and copy SQL error messages.

The TreeDataGrid examples are ready to use if you want to upgrade from the traditional DataGrid for better performance and functionality.

## Recommendation

For your search results display, I recommend:

1. **Short term**: Keep using the existing DataGrid but with the SelectableTextBlock fix
2. **Medium term**: Migrate to TreeDataGrid using the example I provided
3. **Long term**: Consider a commercial grid control if you need advanced features

The TreeDataGrid will give you much better performance with large result sets and more reliable behavior overall.
